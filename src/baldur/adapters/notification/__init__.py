"""OSS notification delivery adapter.

Exposes the OSS-tier outbound notification transport
(:class:`SlackWebhookNotificationAdapter`). It is constructed directly by the
circuit-breaker notification task on an OSS-only install — the single sanctioned
out-of-seam external-push exception to ADR-009's "OSS observes; PRO notifies"
boundary. The notification registry seam itself stays logging-only on OSS, so
nothing here registers into it.
