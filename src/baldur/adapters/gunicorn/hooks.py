"""Gunicorn worker-lifecycle hooks for baldur graceful shutdown.

These callables map to gunicorn server-config hook names and are
imported via the user's gunicorn config (``gunicorn -c``). They wire
baldur's :class:`GracefulShutdownCoordinator` into the worker
lifecycle so that registered handlers (Audit WAL flush, leader-election
release, bulkhead drain, etc.) actually run on SIGTERM.

Hook responsibilities
---------------------

``post_worker_init``
    Marks the process as a gunicorn worker by setting
    ``GUNICORN_WORKER=1``. Initializes the shutdown coordinator with a
    ``RequestTracker`` so ``initiate_shutdown`` has state to drain.
    Installs a *chained* SIGTERM handler (``coordinator.initiate_shutdown``
    → original gunicorn handler), because gunicorn's ``worker_int``
    callback only fires for SIGINT/SIGQUIT — when the master forwards
    SIGTERM to workers (the normal graceful-shutdown path), gunicorn's
    own ``handle_exit`` runs without invoking any user hook. Chaining
    is the only way to plug ``coordinator.initiate_shutdown`` into the
    worker's SIGTERM lifecycle without breaking gunicorn's drain. The
    handler is fast: ``initiate_shutdown`` fires synchronous
    ``on_shutdown_start`` callbacks then spawns a daemon drain thread
    that runs in parallel with gunicorn's HTTP-drain. Then re-starts the
    ``init()``-started background daemon workers in the forked worker for
    **all** adapters via ``baldur.bootstrap.start_background_workers()``
    (they die after fork if started in master, and ``init()`` is not
    re-run per worker), and additionally re-starts the Django-only extra
    threads (gauge hydration, correlation loop) when Django is present.

``worker_int``
    Invoked by gunicorn when SIGINT or SIGQUIT is forwarded to the
    worker. Calls ``coordinator.initiate_shutdown()`` for parity with
    the chained SIGTERM handler installed by ``post_worker_init``.

``worker_exit``
    Invoked by gunicorn after the worker stops accepting traffic, just
    before process termination. Blocks (up to 30s) waiting for the
    coordinator drain thread to complete, then stops Django background
    daemon threads cleanly. The drain timeout defaults to 30s; to use
    a different value, tune ``recovery_shutdown_settings`` and ensure
    gunicorn's ``--graceful-timeout`` is ``>=`` the configured value
    (otherwise gunicorn SIGKILLs the worker before drain completes).

Doc reference: see Cat 1.8 scenario in
``memory/scenario-test-plan-2026-04-12.md`` for the canonical
end-to-end behavior contract.

    bypass baldur. This is acceptable because gunicorn does not re-init
