Adapter: ThrottleAwareBackoffCalculator as BackoffStrategy.

Bridges the services/backoff_calculator layer to the core/backoff.py
BackoffStrategy interface, enabling retry_with_backoff() to use
throttle-aware backoff without coupling to the calculator's API.

Usage:
    from baldur.services.backoff_calculator.strategy_adapter import (
        ThrottleAwareBackoffStrategy,
    )
    from baldur.services.backoff_calculator import ThrottleAwareBackoffCalculator

    calculator = ThrottleAwareBackoffCalculator(config, service_name="payment")
    strategy = ThrottleAwareBackoffStrategy(calculator)

    # Use with retry_with_backoff()
    config = RetryConfig(backoff=strategy)
    outcome = retry_with_backoff(func, config)
