"""
Common type definitions for the baldur system.

History: this module previously contained early-design types (FailureType,
OperationStatus, RetryContext, MetricsSnapshot) that were superseded by:
- interfaces/repositories.py: FailedOperationStatus, FailedOperationDomain
- services/retry_handler/models.py: RetryConfig, RetryResult
- interfaces/statistics.py: StatusCounts, CircuitBreakerSummary
- services/metrics/definitions.py: Prometheus label-based domain metrics

All dead types were removed per 194_DEAD_CODE_REMOVAL_PLAN.md. Per
``504_DLQ_PROTECT_CONTEXT_CAPTURE.md`` D8, this module now hosts the shared
primitive whitelist consumed by ``@idempotent`` (cache key fold-in) and
``@protected`` / ``@dlq_protect`` (context auto-extract for DLQ visibility).

# a structured payload should go through the explicit ``context_from=Callable``
