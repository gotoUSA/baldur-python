Compliance shared models.

OSS-chassis surface of the compliance feature: the enum of supported
standards and the typed execution context. These are consumed by the OSS
settings validators and framework-agnostic API handlers; the compliance
check engine itself lives in the private distribution and imports these
models from here (dependency-inversion direction: private -> baldur.models).
