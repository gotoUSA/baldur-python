Learning shared models.

OSS-chassis surface of the Self-Learning DNA feature: the pattern-type
enum consumed by the framework-agnostic API handlers and by private-tier
consumers (chaos impact prediction, runbook pattern matching, error-budget
shadow calculation). The learning service itself lives in the private
distribution and imports this enum from here (dependency-inversion
direction: private -> baldur.models).
