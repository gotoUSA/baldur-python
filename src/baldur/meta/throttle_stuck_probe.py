"""ThrottleStuckProbe — semantic-stuck detection for the adaptive throttle.

The ``daemon_workers`` catch-all probe covers the throttle audit worker's
*liveness*; that says nothing about whether the throttle *limit* is
recovering. This probe answers the orthogonal "frozen, not just crashed"
question against the throttle state owner (``ProviderRegistry.adaptive_throttle``,
NOT ``ThrottleAuditWorker``): it feeds ``current_limit`` into the shared
``StuckDetector`` and reports UNHEALTHY when the limit is frozen (near-zero
variance) while constrained.

The zero-variance signal is the frozen-vs-adapting discriminator: a throttle
actively managing load moves ``current_limit`` (variance > 0) and is not
flagged; only a *frozen* constrained limit trips. ``constrained`` is
demand-gated so a throttle resting at its floor with no traffic (a legitimate
idle state) is not a false positive. Detect + escalate only.
