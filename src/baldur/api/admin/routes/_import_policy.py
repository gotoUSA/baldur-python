"""Standard policy for broken admin-route import groups.

Each per-domain ``_register_<domain>_routes`` function uses a try/except
around the handler-module imports so a single missing/renamed handler
does not block the rest of the admin routes from registering.

Per docs/impl/526 D7, the except branch follows two different policies
depending on environment:

- ``BALDUR_ENV=dev``: re-raise so broken imports surface immediately during
  local development. mypy alone does not catch all such regressions (some
  paths require runtime resolution); fail-fast at server startup is the
  signal-to-noise win.

- Otherwise (production / CI): WARNING log so SRE has visibility (previously
  ``logger.debug`` was effectively invisible), then fail-open so the rest of
  the admin routes register.

Lives in a dedicated module to keep submodule imports out of the circular
``routes/__init__.py`` path — ``__init__.py`` re-exports the helper for
test convenience.
