# Flask Quickstart

Protect a Flask route with Baldur. No Redis, no Docker, no
environment variables. The in-memory fallback covers the whole first run.

> Supports Python 3.11–3.13. Assumes you have built a Flask app before.

## 1. Install

```bash
pip install baldur-framework[flask]
```

## 2. Wire Baldur into the app

`init_flask(app)` calls `baldur.init()` once and installs the request hooks
(rate-limit, backpressure, circuit-breaker pre-flight). The `/demo` route is
protected by the marquee `@baldur.protected` facade:

```python
--8<-- "examples/quickstart_flask/app.py"
```

!!! note "Baldur does not authenticate your routes"

    The request hooks add resilience (rate-limit, backpressure, circuit
    breaker), **not** authentication. Your app keeps owning endpoint auth
    (Flask-Login, your own decorators). Baldur's own operational surface (the
    built-in admin server and [Web Console](../concepts/foundations/web-console.md))
    is access-controlled separately by a key you configure; see that guide for
    the role model. The Django adapter additionally registers Django permission
    groups for its own admin/API views; there is no equivalent host-app role
    system on Flask.

## 3. Run it

Start the server and call the route:

```bash
flask run
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/demo
# {"status": "ok", "service": "demo"}
```

That's it. The response just travelled through a circuit breaker.

### See Baldur's events

Baldur logs to stdout automatically. Raise the log level to watch circuit
breaker and rate-limit events as you exercise the endpoint:

```bash
export BALDUR_LOG_LEVEL=INFO   # circuit opened/closed, rate-limit blocks, ...
```

### Verify without a browser

The quickstart ships a smoke test that drives the route through Flask's
in-process test client — no server, no infra:

```bash
pytest examples/quickstart_flask/test_smoke.py
```

## Going to production

!!! danger "The in-memory fallback is single-process only"

    The zero-config path uses Baldur's in-memory cache. It keeps state in a
    per-process store, so copying this quickstart into a multi-worker
    deployment (`gunicorn --workers N`) does **not** degrade gracefully:
    idempotency keys, rate-limit counters, and circuit breaker state diverge
    silently per worker. That breaks **correctness**, not just scale. The
    in-memory store also grows unbounded. This is a hazard, not a tuning knob:
    give Baldur a shared backend before you run more than one worker.

Point Baldur at Redis so all workers share state. No code changes needed: set one
environment variable before starting the server:

```bash
pip install baldur-framework[flask,redis]
export BALDUR_REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

That is the only addition the production path needs over the quickstart path.
