# OSS vs PRO: which tier do you need?

> Baldur comes in two tiers — a free open-source core and a paid PRO package for production teams. You start free and upgrade only when you actually need to, without rewriting anything.

## What is it?

Baldur ships in **two tiers**:

- **OSS.** The free, open-source core. Run `pip install baldur-framework`, `import baldur`, and
  you have the resilience building blocks: circuit breaker, retry, idempotency, health checks,
  graceful shutdown, and more. No license, no sign-up, no cost.
- **PRO.** A paid package you add on top of the OSS core once you run Baldur in production with a
  team. It adds the heavier operational machinery: durable storage for failed work, an audit trail,
  coordinated emergency controls, and alerting.

That is the whole model: two tiers, OSS and PRO. Both are the *same* library with the *same*
`@baldur.protected` API; PRO unlocks additional capability rather than replacing anything.

## Why it matters

A lot of reliability tooling forces a decision before you have any context: pick a plan, commit,
integrate. Baldur inverts that. The OSS tier is meant to be **good enough to get hooked** — you
adopt it as an individual developer because it solves a real problem today, for free. You only reach
for PRO once the project is load-bearing enough that a team operates it in production and the
cost of *losing work* or *being blind to a failure* has become real.

That keeps the choice honest:

- **You don't pay to evaluate.** Build on OSS, ship it, and see if it earns its place — at no cost.
- **You reach for PRO when production starts to hurt.** The trigger is a problem you can already
  feel — failed work vanishing on a restart, an incident you only hear about after it's over — not a
  plan you committed to up front. The need pulls you in; nothing pushes you.
- **Upgrading is not a migration.** PRO is the same framework. You add a package and a license key;
  your existing `@baldur.protected` code keeps working and the PRO capabilities light up behind it.

## How it works in Baldur

Adoption runs bottom-up: a developer picks up the free core, the project grows, and PRO joins when
the team is running it in production.

```

### What the OSS core gives you

The free tier is the **resilience patterns themselves** — everything a single service needs to
survive a dependency failing, with zero infrastructure to start:

- [Circuit Breaker](../oss/circuit-breaker.md), [Retry](../oss/retry.md), and
  [Idempotency](../oss/idempotency.md) — handle a failing or flaky dependency without making it
  worse or charging a customer twice.
- [Health Check](../oss/health-check.md) and [Graceful Shutdown](../oss/graceful-shutdown.md) — tell
  a load balancer the truth and drain in-flight work cleanly when the process restarts.
- [Metrics](../oss/metrics.md), [System Control](../oss/system-control.md), and
  [Precomputed Cache](../oss/precomputed-cache.md) — see what's happening and switch protection on
  or off at runtime.

This is enough to make a real service meaningfully more resilient. What it is *not* is everything you
need to **operate** that service across a team, at scale, where work must never be silently lost.

### What PRO adds

PRO is about running Baldur in production — durability, visibility, and coordinated control that a
team depends on. It leads with the operational problem each capability removes:

| Production need | PRO capability |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Failed work must survive restarts, not vanish | [Durable dead-letter queue with replay](../pro/dlq-replay.md) |
| Prove what changed, and what triggered it | [Audit trail](../pro/audit.md) |
| Hear about an incident without watching a dashboard | [Unified notification](../pro/unified-notification.md) |
| Shed load and shrink the blast radius under stress | [Emergency mode](../pro/emergency-mode.md) · [Bulkhead](../pro/bulkhead.md) · [Throttle](../pro/throttle.md) |
| Roll config changes out safely and gate risky automation | [Canary recovery](../pro/canary-recovery.md) · [Governance](../pro/governance.md) |
| Notice when Baldur itself gets stuck | [Meta-Watchdog](../pro/meta-watchdog.md) — detects the stall and escalates to a human |

A PRO subscription includes every PRO feature — capabilities are not sold or unlocked one at a time.

### Graduating without a rewrite

Because both tiers are one framework, moving to PRO does not touch your application code. The
dead-letter queue is the clearest example. On an OSS install you can already write:

```python
@baldur.protected("charge-customer", retry=True, dlq=True)
def charge(order_id: str) -> dict:
    return payment_gateway.charge(order_id)
```

But the durable storage that actually *captures* failed work ships with PRO. Without PRO, `dlq=True`
has nowhere to write, so a final failure is not set aside. Add the PRO package and a license key and
the **exact same code** now records every failed operation durably, survives restarts, and can be
replayed once the dependency recovers. You opted in once; the capability became real when you
upgraded.

## Configuration

OSS needs no configuration to install. PRO is the OSS install plus the PRO package and a license,
supplied through one of these:

| Env Var | What it controls |
|---------|------------------|
| `BALDUR_LICENSE_KEY` | The PRO license, provided inline as a value |
| `BALDUR_LICENSE_FILE` | Path to a file that holds the PRO license |

Individual PRO features carry their own settings, documented in their own guides and the
[environment variable reference](../../reference/env-vars.md). If the PRO package or a valid license
is absent, PRO-only knobs are simply inert — an OSS install never breaks because a PRO setting was
left in place.
