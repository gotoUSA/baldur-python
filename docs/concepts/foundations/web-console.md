# Web Console

> A built-in browser dashboard for operating Baldur — see what's failing and recovering, and act on it, all from one page with no extra setup.

## What is it?

Most monitoring tools are read-only. Grafana, a status page, a metrics dashboard: they draw you a
picture of what is happening, but when something is actually wrong you still have to go *somewhere
else* to fix it: open a terminal, remember the right command, and hope you got the arguments right
while the incident is live.

A **web console** closes that gap by putting the controls next to the gauges. Think of an aircraft
cockpit rather than a car's dashboard: it does not just show you the altitude, it gives you the
levers to change it. You watch the state and you act on it in the same place.

In Baldur's terms, the Web Console is a zero-configuration browser page (served by Baldur's
built-in admin server) that shows your self-healing system's current state *and* lets you take the
recovery actions a read-only dashboard cannot: reset a stuck circuit breaker, stop runaway
automation, or work through a backlog of failed operations.

## Why it matters

During an incident you need to *do* things, fast. Without a console, "reset this breaker" or "stop
the automation" means hand-crafting calls to Baldur's admin API (knowing the exact route, building
the right request body, and remembering which actions are dangerous), or having no interface at all
if you have not stood up a separate monitoring stack.

The Web Console removes that friction. A small team can open a browser to `http://localhost:9090/`
and immediately have an operate-and-recover surface: the current state is already on screen, the
safe actions are buttons, and the dangerous ones are clearly marked and gated. There are no
dashboards to build and no query language to learn. It is the incident-response surface for the
operators who have not stood up (or do not want) a full Grafana deployment, and it does the one
thing Grafana cannot: change the system's state, not just display it.

## How it works in Baldur

Once Baldur is initialized, its built-in admin server starts automatically and serves the console at
`GET /` (by default `http://localhost:9090/`). There is nothing to configure to get there.

The page is a grid of **panels**. Each panel shows a live, current-state view of one subsystem
(the same data you could read from Baldur's admin API) and, where an action makes sense, the buttons
to perform it. Every panel is labelled **OSS** or **PRO** in its header so you always know which
tier you are looking at.

| Panel | Tier | What it shows | What you can do |
|-------|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Dashboard | OSS | The rolled-up self-healing summary — status counts, recent activity, an overall health verdict | — (read-only) |
| Circuit Breakers | OSS | The state of each service's breaker | Reset a breaker |
| System Control | OSS | Whether automation is enabled, and the kill-switch state | Enable or disable (kill-switch) automation, with a dry-run mode |
| Emergency | PRO | The current emergency level | Trigger or release emergency mode |
| Dead Letter Queue | PRO | The backlog of failed operations, browsable entry by entry | Replay, archive, or purge; retry or resolve a single entry |
| Bulkheads | PRO | Per-compartment concurrency usage | — (read-only) |
| Canary Rollouts | PRO | In-flight canary rollouts | — (read-only) |
| Adaptive Throttle | PRO | The current auto-tuning state | — (read-only) |
| Governance | PRO | The pending-approval queue | — (read-only) |
| Meta-Watchdog | PRO | The self-monitor's health | Force a check, or send a test escalation |

**Panels reflect what is actually running.** A PRO panel appears only when its backing service is
genuinely active — the console keys off whether the service is registered (what is running), not off
what a license file claims. If a PRO service is not installed or not started, its panel is simply
absent rather than greyed-out or broken.

**Actions are tiered by risk.** The console mirrors the server's own permission model so the
interface matches what the server will actually allow:

| What you observe | When it happens |
|------------------|-----------------|
| A simple "Proceed?" confirmation | A reversible action — for example, replaying a dead-lettered entry |
| A typed `CONFIRM` prompt, plus a note that the server must be unlocked | A destructive action — for example, resetting a breaker, purging the queue, or flipping the kill-switch. The server refuses these with a `403` until it has been explicitly unlocked, and the console names the exact switch to set (`BALDUR_ADMIN_UNLOCK=1`) |
| An extra real-world warning | An action with an external side effect — for example, the Meta-Watchdog escalation test, which warns that it will send a *real* notification to every configured channel |

That unlock requirement is a deliberate second gate: a console left open in a browser tab cannot be
used to force-open production, because the destructive actions stay locked at the server until an
operator turns the switch on intentionally.

**Safe by default, hardened for exposure.** Out of the box the console binds to localhost only, so
it is not reachable from other machines. Reaching it from elsewhere means placing it behind your own
TLS proxy and setting an admin key, which you enter once in the header bar; the console then sends it
with each request. The page is hardened against DNS-rebinding by checking the request's origin, and
every load carries a fresh content-security-policy nonce. All data is rendered as plain text, never
as HTML, so a hostile value in your own data cannot script the page.

**Built for incidents.** You reach for this console precisely when things are wedged, so it is built
to stay usable under stress: each panel loads independently (one panel failing shows an inline
error and leaves the rest working) and every request times out quickly so an unresponsive backend
cannot hang the browser. An optional auto-refresh toggle (off by default) keeps the panels current
during an active incident.

## Configuration

The Web Console needs no configuration to use. Once Baldur is initialized the built-in admin server
starts automatically and serves the console at `http://localhost:9090/`.

None of the admin server's settings are part of the stable v1.0 operator allowlist yet — they are
advanced settings that may change before they are promoted to the stable operator contract.
Reaching the console from beyond localhost (a different bind address behind your own proxy), setting
an access key, naming additional allowed origins, unlocking destructive actions, or turning the
console off entirely are all done through those admin-server settings; see the
[API Reference](../../reference/index.md) for the current names and values.

## Tier behavior

The Web Console is one console for both tiers; what scopes by tier is *which panels appear*.

- **In OSS**: the console is a complete operate-and-recover surface for the core resilience layer.
  You get the OSS panels — the Dashboard summary (the at-a-glance self-healing picture), Circuit
  Breakers with one-click reset, and System Control (the kill-switch, including a dry-run mode).
  Every panel is labelled OSS, and none of it depends on PRO.

- **With PRO active**: additional panels appear automatically as their backing PRO services start —
  Emergency mode, the Dead Letter Queue (browse, replay, archive, purge), Bulkheads, Canary
  rollouts, Adaptive Throttle, Governance, and the Meta-Watchdog self-monitor. They surface only
  when the service is actually running, so the console always reflects what is genuinely available.
  Nothing about the OSS panels changes; the PRO panels are purely additive.
