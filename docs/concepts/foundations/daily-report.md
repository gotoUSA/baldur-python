# Daily Report

> Once a day, Baldur rolls everything it did to keep your services healthy into one short digest — so you can tell at a glance whether yesterday was calm or a near-miss, without opening a dashboard.

## What is it?

Most monitoring shouts at you in the moment: an alert fires, a dashboard turns red, and you go
look. A **daily report** is the calm opposite: a scheduled summary that arrives once a day and
tells you what happened over the last 24 hours and what was handled automatically. Think of it as
the end-of-shift handover note an on-call engineer leaves for the next person: *here's what broke,
here's what recovered, here's what still needs eyes.*

In Baldur's terms, the Daily Report gathers a full day of self-healing activity — circuit-breaker
trips, recoveries, and errors — and rolls it into a single digest, kept as a running history you
can look back through.

## Why it matters

Self-healing is mostly invisible when it works. Baldur quietly retries a flaky call, trips a circuit
before a slow dependency drags everything down, returns a fallback so a user never sees an error,
and if none of that ever surfaces, you have no idea whether the system is coasting or quietly
catching fires all day.

The Daily Report makes the invisible visible. One digest a day answers the question every operator
actually has (*is everything OK?*) without anyone opening a dashboard. On a calm day it collapses
to a single "all quiet" line, so a report that suddenly runs long is itself the signal that
yesterday was busy. For a small team with nobody watching screens, it's the cheapest possible proof
that your safety net is doing its job.

## How it works in Baldur

Once a day, Baldur builds a report for the previous day from the activity it recorded, stores it, and
keeps a rolling history (about three months by default) that you can query by date.

The report is **adaptive**, to stay readable:

- A core summary line is **always** present — it confirms the report ran at all.
- Detail sections (circuit-breaker activity, errors, and the like) appear **only when they have
  something to report**. A day with no incidents collapses to a single line: *"All quiet —
  0 processed, 0 alerts."*
- The report's severity is derived from its contents: a clean day is *info*, task failures make it
  *warning*, a critical alert makes it *critical*.

How you *get* the report depends on your tier — you either pull it on demand or have it delivered:

| What you observe | When it happens |
|------------------|-----------------|
| `baldur report` (or the report API / admin console) returns the day's digest and a multi-day trend | Any time — the report is generated and stored in every tier |
| An *"All quiet — 0 processed, 0 alerts"* one-liner | The day had no healing activity and no incidents |
| Expanded detail sections | Those events actually occurred that day |
| The digest pushed to your Slack automatically each morning | **PRO** — see *Tier behavior* below |
| A "what you're missing" insights block inside the report | **OSS only** — see *Tier behavior* below |

The report ships **disabled by default**; you turn it on once you want the daily digest.

## Configuration

The Daily Report's knobs — whether it's on, when it runs, how long history is kept, and how often
the insights block appears — are treated as advanced settings in v1.0 rather than part of the stable
operator environment-variable allowlist, so they may change before they're promoted. See the
[API Reference](../../reference/index.md) for the current settings; the report is **off by default**.

Reading a stored report needs no extra configuration — the CLI talks to the same data the report API
serves:

```bash
baldur report                 # list recent reports
baldur report --date today    # show one day's report (or any YYYY-MM-DD)
```

## Tier behavior

The Daily Report runs in every tier, but *how you get it* and *what it contains* scope to the
features you have active.

- **In OSS**: Baldur generates the report from your real activity, keeps the rolling history, and you
  **read it on demand** — `baldur report` on the command line, or the report API / admin console.
  Because OSS detects and reports but does not *act* on failures the way PRO does, the report also
  carries a **"what you're missing" insights block**: drawn entirely from your own production
  numbers, it estimates the impact the PRO features would have had — for example *N circuit-breaker
  trips with no automatic degradation*, *N operations that failed permanently with nowhere to capture
  them for retry*, or *N drift warnings you had to resolve by hand*. It's a directional estimate from
  your data, not a synthetic demo, and it appears on a cadence you control.

- **With PRO active**: the same report is **delivered to Slack automatically** each day — Baldur's
  notification transports ship with PRO, so in OSS the report is generated and stored but pushing it
  to a channel is a PRO capability. The "what you're missing" block disappears, because you are no
  longer missing it. In its place the report gains an **"Automated Actions" section** showing what
  PRO actually *did* while you were away — dead-letter batches auto-replayed, canary rollouts and
  rollbacks, emergency-level changes, governance blocks — alongside richer
  sections fed by the PRO features. The same daily digest shifts from *"here's what you're missing"*
  to *"here's what was handled for you."*
