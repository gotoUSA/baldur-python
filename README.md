**Baldur** is a self-healing reliability layer for Python applications. It puts
circuit breaker, retry, and fallback behind a single decorator, so a flaky
downstream stops cascading into your service. Durable dead-letter queue, audit,
and replay are available in [Baldur PRO](https://baldur.sh). The core is framework-agnostic, with
first-class adapters for Django, FastAPI, and Flask.

## Install

The Python package is `baldur` (you `import baldur`); the PyPI distribution is
`baldur-framework`.

```bash
pip install baldur-framework                 # framework-agnostic core
pip install baldur-framework[django]         # Django integration
pip install baldur-framework[fastapi]        # FastAPI integration
pip install baldur-framework[flask]          # Flask integration
pip install baldur-framework[celery]         # Celery task protection
pip install baldur-framework[redis]          # Redis-backed shared state
pip install baldur-framework[prometheus]     # Prometheus metrics
```

## Quick example

```python
import baldur


@baldur.protected("charge-customer")
def charge(order_id: str) -> dict:
    # Wrapped in a circuit breaker by default. With zero configuration this
    # runs on an in-memory fallback — no Redis, no env vars, no Docker.
    return payment_gateway.charge(order_id)
```

`@baldur.protected("name")` composes circuit breaker, retry, and fallback into
one pipeline. Add Redis (`pip install baldur-framework[redis]`,
`BALDUR_REDIS_URL=...`) when you move to multiple workers so the state is shared.

## Quickstart

Pick your framework and have a protected endpoint running:

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/index.md) — Django, FastAPI, Flask
- **Full documentation & concept guides:** <https://baldur.sh>

## Compatibility

| FastAPI | 0.100 | latest ≥ floor (smoke) |
| Flask | 2.3 | latest ≥ floor (smoke) |
| Celery | 5.3 | 5.4 |
| Redis server | — | 7.x |

Python × Django test grid, and the version support policy.

## Using Baldur with AI assistants

Building with an AI coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex)? Run
`baldur init-ai` in your repo to drop an `AGENTS.md` (read by Cursor, Copilot,
and Codex) plus a `CLAUDE.md` that imports it for Claude Code — together they
teach the assistant to reach for `@baldur.protected("name")` instead of
hand-rolling a circuit breaker. See
[Using Baldur with AI assistants](docs/getting-started/ai-assistants.md).
