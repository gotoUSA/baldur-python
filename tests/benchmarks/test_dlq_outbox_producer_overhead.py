"""Cat 7A.7 — DLQ outbox producer-side latency micro-benchmark.

Plan ref: `memory/scenario-test-plan-2026-04-12.md` §436 row 7A.7
Targets:  producer p50 < 1 μs, p99 < 10 μs, drop_rate < 1%
Setup:    `outbox.put({...kwargs...})` directly — isolates the producer hot
          path (RingBuffer.put) from the surrounding `_dispatch_to_outbox`
          Python-call overhead. Verifies the #486 docstring claim of
          producer-side ~50-100 ns lock-bounded RingBuffer.put cost.

Why measure `outbox.put` directly rather than the full `protect()` chain
under `BALDUR_DLQ_OUTBOX_ENABLED=true`: the plan target (1 μs / 10 μs) is an
order of magnitude smaller than `protect()`'s composer + RetryPolicy +
PolicyResult overhead (already measured by 7A.2). Only `Outbox.put` itself
matches the structural floor the plan asserts. The wider chain is constant
and well-understood; the formal regression gate must isolate the hot path.

Two complementary measurement paths (matching 7A.1-7A.6 layout):

1. **Manual ns-resolution loop** (`test_outbox_put_producer_quantiles`) —
   `time.perf_counter_ns()` around 8000 inner iterations after a 100-call
   warmup + `flush_and_wait(2s)` drain. Computes p50 / p99 / p999 from the
   raw sample list via `statistics.quantiles(..., n=1000)`.

2. **pytest-benchmark cross-validation**
   (`test_outbox_put_producer_pytest_benchmark`) — standard
   `benchmark(callable)` invocation. Provides median / iqr / ops.

The first run of either test establishes BASELINE per plan §484-488; PASS/FAIL
verdict is recorded by the /scenario harness, not by these tests.

Capacity sizing rationale (G5): measurement count 8000 < default capacity
10000, so even if the worker drains zero entries during the producer's
~8 ms wall-clock window, the buffer never fills and DROP_OLDEST never fires —
giving a deterministic drop_rate=0%. Warmup (100) is drained via
`flush_and_wait(2s)` BEFORE measurement so warmup entries do not crowd the
capacity headroom during the measurement window.
