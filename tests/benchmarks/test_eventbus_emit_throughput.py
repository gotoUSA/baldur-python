"""Cat 7A.5 — EventBus emit throughput micro-benchmark.

Plan ref: `memory/scenario-test-plan-2026-04-12.md` §435 row 7A.5
Setup:    Emit ``EventType.EMERGENCY_LEVEL_CHANGED`` events with exactly 5
          registered handlers on a fresh ``BaldurEventBus()`` instance,
          measuring per-emit synchronous-dispatch overhead. Plan target
          translated to absolute thresholds (Section 2 Gap #1, /scenario
          Stage 3 sync 2026-05-07): "10,000 events/sec sustained" =>
          per-emit p50 <= 100 us / p99 <= 200 us / p999 <= 500 us.

Plan rationale ("Verify synchronous dispatch doesn't create backlog")
maps to two correctness gates measured alongside latency:

  - G6: ``bus.get_stats()['handler_timeouts'] == 0`` over the entire
    measurement loop. A non-zero count proves a handler exceeded the
    ``handler_timeout_seconds`` budget and was silently dropped, which is
    the exact failure mode plan asks to falsify.
  - G7: ``sum(_handler_counters) == _MEASURE_ITERATIONS * 5``. Every one
    of the 5 handlers must have fired on every iteration. If a regression
    drops handler invocations (e.g. duplicate-name dedup at subscribe time,
    Thread.start failure, or join-timeout silent skip), G7 catches it
    while wall-clock numbers would still look "fast".

Why fresh ``BaldurEventBus()`` (NOT singleton ``get_event_bus()``):
``register_default_handlers()`` (called only by ``bootstrap.py:380`` in
production startup) wires ~30+ handlers across many EventTypes. The
singleton in a multi-test session would have whatever default handlers
the bootstrap path wired — diverging from plan §435's "5 registered
handlers" specification. Fresh instance guarantees exactly 5 handlers
(verified at G1 via ``len(bus.get_subscriptions(...))==5``) while the
underlying ``BaldurEventBus`` class is identical to what the singleton
returns; the dispatch hot path measured here is byte-identical to
production. Pattern precedent: 12 baldur test files instantiate
``BaldurEventBus()`` directly (e.g. ``tests/unit/services/test_event_bus_unit.py``).

Why default ``handler_timeout_seconds = 5.0`` (production posture, NOT
override to 0): the production hot path goes through
``_execute_handler_with_timeout`` (`event_bus.py:75-113`) which spawns a
``threading.Thread(daemon=True)`` per handler when timeout > 0. The plan
rationale "synchronous dispatch doesn't create backlog" *targets exactly
this code path* — Thread.start()/join() per handler is the structural
source of any potential backlog under sustained 10K/s emit pressure.
Override to 0 would skip the Thread branch entirely (`event_bus.py:82-84`
inline call) and report numbers from a code path no production caller
ever takes. Posture decision recorded as Section 2 Gap #2 in the
/scenario Stage 3 sync.

Two complementary measurement paths (matching 7A.1/7A.2/7A.3/7A.4 layout):

1. **Manual ns-resolution loop** (``test_eventbus_emit_quantiles``) —
   ``time.perf_counter_ns()`` around 10000 inner iterations after a 1000-
   call warmup. Computes p50 / p99 / p999 from the raw sample list via
   ``statistics.quantiles(..., n=1000)``. Records OPS = N / total_wall.

2. **pytest-benchmark cross-validation** (``test_eventbus_emit_pytest_benchmark``)
   — standard ``benchmark(callable)`` invocation. Provides median / iqr / ops.

The first run of either test establishes BASELINE per plan §484-488;
PASS/FAIL verdict is recorded by the /scenario harness, not by these
tests.

Why no ``clear_history()`` between warmup and measurement: ``_record_event``
appends to ``_event_history`` and rotates via list slicing once
``len > _max_history`` (default 1000). The rotation cost (O(N) slice on
every emit at steady state) is part of what production callers pay; not
clearing matches the steady-state posture this row is meant to baseline.
