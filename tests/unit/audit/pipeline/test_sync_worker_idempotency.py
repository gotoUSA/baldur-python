"""
AuditSyncWorker Idempotent Consumer tests.

Test scope:
1. ``_sync_entry_to_adapter()`` integration with ``IdempotencyService`` against
   the **real** ``IdempotencyResult`` contract — the value-based
   ``result.is_duplicate`` dedup gate (the inverted ``result is not None`` gate
   skipped every first write) + the canonical ``mark_as_processed`` post-write
   marking (replacing the ``check()``-as-setter hack).
2. Duplicate-entry skip behavior.
3. Central-outage -> recovery WAL-replay zero-loss: an entry buffered in WAL
   while central is down is re-written after recovery, and the WAL file is not
   unlinked before the successful central write.
4. No-adapter-wired guard: a drain with no central destination advances neither
   the cursor nor deletes the WAL, and warns once per unwired episode.
