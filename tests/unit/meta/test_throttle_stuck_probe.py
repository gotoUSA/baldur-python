"""ThrottleStuckProbe unit tests (638 D7).

The throttle semantic-stuck probe feeds ``current_limit`` into the shared
``StuckDetector`` and reports UNHEALTHY when the limit is frozen (near-zero
variance) while constrained. ``constrained`` is demand-gated: a throttle resting
at its floor (``current_limit <= min_limit``) is flagged ONLY when rejections are
rising since the previous tick — so an idle / low-traffic throttle parked at the
floor is not a false positive. ``full_stop`` / ``emergency`` stay ungated.

OSS-only: the probe duck-types ``get_stats()`` (a plain dict), so these tests
fake the throttle without importing baldur_pro.

Shared-singleton isolation: the probe records into the module-singleton
``StuckDetector``; every test resets it (setup + teardown) to avoid cross-test
sample bleed. The probe instance persists ``_prev_rejected_requests`` across
ticks, so each test reuses ONE probe instance and calls ``probe()`` N times.

Covers:
- variance path (≥5 constrained frozen samples → UNHEALTHY)
- adapting limit (variance > 0 → HEALTHY even while constrained)
- demand-gate (at-floor + flat rejections → HEALTHY; rising rejections → UNHEALTHY)
- cold-start (< 5 samples → HEALTHY)
- prev-rejected delta tracking across ticks
- fail-safe (get_stats raises → UNKNOWN)
- is_applicable() state-based + fail-safe
