"""
Meta-watchdog unit test isolation (autouse fixtures).

Rationale:
    HealthProbeManager starts a daemon worker thread that runs `probe_all()`
    in a loop; `probe_all()` creates a short-lived ThreadPoolExecutor per
    probe. When a test constructs a manager (directly or indirectly via
    SelfHealerWatchdog) and calls `start()` without a matching `stop()`, the
    worker keeps running. During interpreter shutdown it races the
    ThreadPoolExecutor and logs `cannot schedule new futures after
    interpreter shutdown`. More importantly, the leaked worker may still
    hold references to module-level probes that other tests are mocking,
    producing order-dependent flakes.

    Instance tracking via `weakref.WeakSet` on `__init__` lets the teardown
    fixture call `stop()` on every alive manager without keeping them alive.

Reference:
    docs/laws/UNIT_TEST_GUIDELINES.md §6.5 (xdist parallel isolation).

    that is still running has `stop()` invoked so its worker thread exits
    deterministically before the next test runs.

    DLQProbe.probe() records each tick's pending_count into the

    accumulates samples across ticks. The root-conftest singleton reset runs
    only at module scope — too coarse to isolate within-file accumulation
    tests that drive >=5 probe() cycles — and the function-scope
    auto_reset_all_state does not cover this detector. A per-function reset is
    safe: the detector has no other production consumer, so resetting it can
    never perturb an unrelated test (the standalone test_stuck_detector.py
    already resets explicitly, so the extra reset is idempotent there).
