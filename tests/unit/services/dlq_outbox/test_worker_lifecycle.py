"""DLQOutboxWorker lifecycle unit tests (impl 489 D9).

Test targets:
    - DLQOutboxWorker._spawn_thread — rebinds handle.thread on respawn
    - DLQOutboxWorker.stop — orders is_stopping → join → unregister → is_alive log
    - DLQOutboxWorker._writer_loop_with_crash_capture — populates last_crash_reason
      for BaseException; re-raises (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit) without recording

These complete the Test Assessment rows that the e2e suite only touches
indirectly:
    - TestDLQOutboxWorkerSpawnHelperBehavior
    - TestDLQOutboxWorkerStopOrderBehavior
    - TestDLQOutboxWorkerCrashCaptureBehavior
