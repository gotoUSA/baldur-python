"""Concurrency correctness for the LayeredRepository L2 quarantine state (579).

The four quarantine fields — ``_l2_consecutive_failures``, ``_l2_healthy``,
``_l2_was_unhealthy``, ``_l2_last_error_time`` — are mutated from up to 16
``l2_sync`` executor threads. 579 atomizes the failure-count read-modify-write
and the healthy<->quarantined transition decision under ``self._lock`` and fires
the WARNING + audit + notification trio exactly once per transition without
holding the lock across any I/O. These tests assert, with real
``threading.Thread`` fan-out + mocks:

- **lost-increment (G1/D2)** — N x M concurrent failures total exactly N*M; a
  lockless regression undercounts under write-write contention.
- **quarantine-edge one-shot (G2/D3/D4)** — the *behavior change* the doc owns:
  ``_log_l2_failure_audit`` / ``_send_l2_failure_notification`` now fire exactly
  once on the healthy->quarantined edge instead of per-failure-past-threshold,
  both sequentially and under N concurrent threads, and the audit call carries
  the **captured edge value** (3), not a post-release re-read.
- **recovery-edge one-shot (G3/D3)** — the recovery audit / notification / drift
  trio fires once on the quarantined->healthy edge under concurrency.
- **consistent admin snapshot (G4/D6)** — ``get_l2_health`` / ``get_storage_info``
  never expose ``l2_healthy=True`` together with ``consecutive_failures >= 3``,
  including while ``reset_l2_health`` races the failure handlers.

The quarantine-entry **WARNING** one-shot (``layered_repo.l2_quarantined``) is
already covered by ``test_l2_sync_quarantine.py::TestL2QuarantineEntryWarning``
via ``capture_logs``. This file deliberately proves the audit/notification
one-shot (the actual D4 change) through ``patch.object`` spies instead: spies are
scheduling-deterministic and do not depend on ``structlog.testing.capture_logs``,
which has a known module-``logger`` freeze residual under ``-n6`` (UNIT_TEST_
GUIDELINES §6.5.9). Re-adding a per-file ``structlog`` guard would also violate
the G34 fitness function.

Pure-OSS: imports only ``baldur`` code, no ``baldur_pro`` — the notification
path's ``baldur_pro`` import lives inside the spied/patched
``_send_l2_*_notification``, so this test never imports it. Stays in
``tests/`` with no ``requires_pro`` marker.
