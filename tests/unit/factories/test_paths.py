"""Unit tests for ``tests/factories/paths.py`` — location-robust repo/src root (663 D1).

The helper replaces the fixed-depth ``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]`` path
computation that broke on the published OSS mirror, where ``publish_mirror.sh``
renames ``tests/`` -> ``tests/`` (shortening the tree by one level so a fixed
depth climbs one level too high). These tests assert the walk-to-marker contract
holds in BOTH layouts: the result holds ``pyproject.toml`` and ``src/baldur``
regardless of depth, keyed on a marker present in both layouts rather than a count.

Test plan source: docs/impl/663_MIRROR_CI_PRO_ABSENT_GREEN.md `## Test Assessment`.
