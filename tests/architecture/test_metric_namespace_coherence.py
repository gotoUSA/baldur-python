"""G49 — every registered framework metric series MUST be ``baldur_``-prefixed.

The framework migrated to a ``baldur_``-prefixed per-domain recorder layer
(``metrics/recorders/*``, ``PREFIX="baldur"``), but the older bare-name
registrations in ``services/metrics/definitions.py`` lingered as dead duplicates
shadowed by their prefixed twins — a consumer could name a
registered-but-never-populated bare series (``circuit_breaker_state``,
``dlq_pending_count``, ...) and silently get nothing (impl doc 655 D1 deleted
that class). G43/G48 guard the *consumer* surface (a dashboard/alert names a live
series) but neither prevents a *producer*-side re-registration of a dead bare
duplicate — G43 explicitly documents that a "registered-but-dead name would
pass: population is a runtime property a static gate cannot assert".

This guard closes that hole on the *producer* surface. The literal invariant
"every registered series has a live producer" is statically infeasible
(population is runtime), so the enforceable proxy is **prefix coherence**: every
framework series is ``baldur_``-prefixed except a small, explicitly-allowlisted
set of surviving legacy *live* bare families. A re-introduced bare duplicate (or
a new producer that forgets the prefix) is neither ``baldur_``-prefixed nor
allowlisted, so it turns the build red.

**Why a subprocess snapshot (NOT G43/G48's in-process fixture).** G43/G48 ask a
*subset* question ("are the names my dashboard/alert references present?"), so an
in-process snapshot of the shared global ``REGISTRY`` is fine — extra names other
tests registered are harmless. G49 asks the *inverse* ("is any UNEXPECTED bare
name present?"), which the shared registry breaks: by the time an in-process
fixture runs, the xdist worker's session has accumulated bare metrics that test
modules register to the global default registry (e.g. ``test_throttle_metrics``
registers bare ``throttle_rtt_ms`` / ``throttle_gradient``). Those are
test-only pollution, not framework producers, but an in-process snapshot can't
tell them apart. So G49 takes its snapshot in a **fresh subprocess** that imports
only the controlled registration set — the same isolation pattern
``test_registry_no_prometheus`` uses — making the verdict deterministic and
independent of whatever else the session registered.

**Controlled registration set** — the subprocess imports
``services.metrics.definitions`` + ``...recorders`` (the module-level series),
instantiates ``BaldurMetrics()`` directly (the per-domain recorder series,
profile-independent), and imports ``metrics.audit_buffer_metrics`` (the one wired
live module that still uses bare names) so the full documented bare surface is
exercised against the allowlist.

**Scope boundary** — name *coherence* (namespace), NOT population (identical to
G43/G48). The allowlist is the documented migration debt; migrating those live
bare names to a ``baldur_`` prefix is a breaking rename of populated metrics,
parked as a follow-up.
