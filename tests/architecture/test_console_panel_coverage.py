"""Impl 585 — G35 admin-console panel-coverage fitness function.

A mutating OPERATOR/ADMIN control **feature-domain** (a route path-prefix on the
admin route registry) MUST be exposed by a ``console.html`` ``PANELS`` entry or
be listed in ``_PANEL_EXEMPT_DOMAINS`` with a justification (G1). This closes the
coverage-direction blind spot that let #582 (System Control / kill switch) and
#583 (Meta-Watchdog) ship routed control features with no console surface — the
existing console leak-guards (``test_console_handler.py``) are anti-leak only
(they catch an *extra* v1.1 panel, but are structurally blind to a *missing*
panel because a forgotten panel drops out of the slot map and its hardcoded
oracle simultaneously, so equality still holds).

G35 also pins the one un-pinned edge of the 3-way panel-set triangle the existing
leak-guards already half-pin: ``PANELS pro:true ids == set(_V1_PRO_PANEL_SLOTS)``
(G2/D4). It does NOT touch the test-module oracle ``_V1_PANEL_KEYS`` — collapsing
that into the slot map would degrade the leak-guard to a tautology (D4).

The gate is keyed on the **domain** (first non-parameter path segment), not the
individual route (D1): the console exposes one panel per feature-domain showing a
curated subset of actions, so a route-level predicate would false-positive on the
non-action mutating routes inside already-paneled domains. The blind spot the gate
targets is a feature-domain with *no panel at all* (the #582/#583 shape).

Impl 634 adds **G44** (``TestConsolePanelStatusActionCoherence``), a complementary
*intra-panel* coherence gate: for every ``PANELS`` entry that has ≥1 action, every
action's domain MUST equal the panel's status domain (unless the panel id is in the
enforced-empty ``_CROSS_DOMAIN_PANELS`` allowlist). G35 unions a panel's status +
action domains into one covered-set, so it is structurally blind to a panel whose
status reads one subsystem while its action mutates another — exactly the bug that
let the Circuit Breakers panel display *audit-backend* CBs while its Reset action
targeted *application service* CBs. G44 splits the ``PANELS`` block per panel (on
``id:`` boundaries) and asserts status-domain == action-domain(s) per panel.
