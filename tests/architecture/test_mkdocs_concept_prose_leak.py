r"""G29 — no published-prose leaks in the public concept-guide layer.

Wave 7C authors public concept guides under ``docs/concepts/``
(``baldur.sh/concepts/``). ``CONCEPT_GUIDE_STANDARDS.md`` §6 bans four leak
classes from that hand-authored ``.md`` prose; this rule machine-enforces it.

The leak classes (the §6 ban-list):

* internal doc-IDs (``NNN D/G/R/C`` / ``ADR-NN`` / ``Wave NN`` / ``#NNNN`` /
  ``OOS`` / ``DEC-NN``) and ``docs/{impl,laws,self_healing}/...`` path refs,
* ``.py:NN`` file:line citations,
* private-distribution paths (``baldur_dormant.*`` AND ``baldur_pro.*``),
* internal symbol names not in the public ``__all__`` — of which this gate
  mechanizes the unambiguous subset: a ``baldur.``-rooted dotted path with a
  private ``._segment`` (④-a-dotted) and a bare unqualified private ``_name``
  inside an inline code-span (④-a-bare, dunder-excluded).

**Mechanized ↔ judgment boundary (§6/§9).** The "public-looking internal
symbol" class — no underscore, not in ``__all__`` — and a bare *unqualified*
private symbol pasted into a fenced example block are NOT mechanized here. A
zero-false-positive gate cannot distinguish them from public symbols, env vars,
literals, or legitimate OSS locals without importing the private ``__all__``,
which a mirror-safe ``tests/`` gate cannot do (G19/G20). The verification
skill (``CONCEPT_GUIDE_STANDARDS.md`` §9) owns that residual as a
quote-and-match judgment.

**Scope (§6 / 562 D3).** A raw-line scan of ``docs/concepts/**`` read directly
from the source tree — independent of the ``mkdocs.yml`` ``exclude_docs``
publish wiring, so the gate fires the moment a guide is authored. HTML comments
(``<!-- -->``) are INCLUDED: Python-Markdown passes them through to published
HTML, so a private path in a comment is a real view-source leak. Files whose
path carries an ``_``-prefixed component are EXCLUDED (mkdocs treats them as
unpublished); ``_TEMPLATE.md`` in particular carries the §6 ban-list as
instructional examples and must not self-trip the gate.

**Anti-vacuous (562 D4), two layers.** Layer 1: synthetic ``_FIXTURE_WITH_LEAK``
/ ``_FIXTURE_CLEAN`` constants keep the matcher live independently of the real
tree. Layer 2: the discovery-wiring assertion proves the concepts-dir glob
resolves ``_TEMPLATE.md`` — a broken glob path fails loudly instead of scanning
zero files forever. Asserting the *published-guide set* is non-empty is
forbidden (false at land time, when only ``_TEMPLATE.md`` exists).

Baseline is enforced-empty (no ``baseline.yaml`` key) — same discipline as
G20–G28. A confirmed false positive tightens the matcher, never gets baselined.
