"""Architectural fitness function — no consumer may reach into a backend-private
metric recorder attribute (645 D6 / G45).

``metrics/event_handlers.py`` historically recorded domain metrics by reaching
into prometheus_client-private recorder internals — the
``metrics.<recorder>._<private>.labels(...).set()/.inc()/.observe()`` shape. That
shape assumes the Prometheus backend's recorder layout; under the OTel metrics
backend the per-domain recorders expose a different internal shape, so every such
access raised ``AttributeError`` (swallowed by the handler's fail-open envelope)
and the metric was silently dropped. The defect was behaviorally invisible — a
dead recording path changes no test output — so only a live smoke caught it.

This rule locks the invariant: outside the metric OWNERS (the recorder classes
and the two backend facades, which legitimately touch their own ``self._x``
instruments), no module may chain ``*.{dlq|retry|circuit_breaker|replay|infra|
throttle}._<private>.(labels|set|inc|observe|add)``. Consumers must route through
the recorder public methods (``record_state_change`` / ``record_trip`` / ...),
which both backends implement.

The trailing recording-call anchor (``.labels|set|inc|observe|add``) is
load-bearing: a bare private-attribute reference with no recording call — e.g.
``SafeGauge(metrics.dlq._pending_gauge)`` in ``event_handlers.py`` — is an
intentional fast-path wrapper and stays exempt. Do NOT tighten this rule to flag
bare ``_<private>`` references.
