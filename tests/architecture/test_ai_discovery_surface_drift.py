"""Fitness function: the AI-discovery surface must not teach a stale API.

The AI-discovery surface ships two artifacts that *teach* Baldur's API to LLMs:

1. ``mkdocs.yml``'s ``llmstxt`` per-link descriptions + ``markdown_description``
   (rendered into the public ``site/llms.txt`` / ``llms-full.txt``).
2. ``AGENTS_GUIDANCE`` — the constant ``baldur init-ai`` writes into a user's
   ``AGENTS.md``.

Both name concrete public symbols (``@protected``, ``BaldurError``, decorator
keywords). Because the artifacts are *consumed by AI assistants* rather than
executed, ``mkdocs build --strict`` and the grep-based success criteria pass
even when a name goes stale — the artifact then confidently teaches a
non-existent symbol (``except SelfHealingError`` after the base class was
renamed to ``BaldurError``) or a PRO-only ``@bulkhead`` as if it were OSS. A
reader who is an LLM cannot tell the difference, so the drift is invisible to
every other gate.

This fitness function asserts that every public-API name the two artifacts
mention still resolves against the live OSS surface. A future rename then fails
the suite instead of silently shipping a misleading discovery surface.

Scope is OSS-only: it imports ``baldur`` (never ``baldur_pro``), so a PRO-only
symbol named in an OSS description is correctly flagged as unresolved — the OSS
docs site must not advertise PRO-tier symbols as part of the OSS API.
