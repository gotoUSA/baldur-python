"""G6 — Health check naming contract (`is_healthy` MUST be a property).

CLAUDE.md § Pattern Compliance distinguishes:
- ``health_check()`` — adapter interface contract (I/O), normal method.
- ``is_healthy`` — cached state query (no I/O), MUST be a property.
- ``check_health()`` — active monitor probe (expensive I/O), normal method.

Per D8 this test enforces the *naming layer* only; semantic checks (does the
body actually perform I/O?) are explicitly OOS — they would require runtime
tracing.

Detection: ``ast.FunctionDef`` named ``is_healthy`` inside any ``ClassDef``
that does NOT carry a ``@property`` decorator. Module-level ``is_healthy``
functions are not flagged (rare, intentional shape).
