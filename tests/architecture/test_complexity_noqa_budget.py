"""G41 - the grandfathered complexity-noqa debt MUST shrink monotonically.

601 D3 selects the three complexity rules (C901 / PLR0912 / PLR0915) at ruff's
default thresholds so the gate is live for NEW code immediately, and
grandfathers the pre-existing violations with ``ruff check --add-noqa`` (one
``# noqa`` line per offending ``def``, regardless of how many of the three rules
that ``def`` trips). This gate caps the grandfathered debt with an **exact-match
ratchet**, not a ``>=`` floor:

- ``count > budget`` fails with "new complexity debt added - refactor or
  justify": new code cannot grandfather itself by adding a complexity noqa.
- ``count < budget`` fails with "you reduced debt - lower the budget": a refactor
  that removes a noqa MUST ratchet the budget down in the same commit, so the
  freed slack can never be silently re-filled by a new complex ``def``.

The ``>=`` form was rejected because it only closes the bypass leak at landing;
after a refactor drops the count below an untouched budget, the slack
(``budget - count``) can be silently reclaimed, reopening the leak. Exact-match
forces every reduction to ratchet the budget, so the closed-leak guarantee holds
over time.

**Per-root budget (OSS-mirror-robust).** The budget is a per-root map, not a
single scalar: the published mirror ships ``src/baldur`` but not the private
``baldur_pro`` / ``baldur_dormant`` trees, so a single all-``src`` exact count
would fail on an OSS-only checkout (precedent: G20/G21/G38/G39 are all
mirror-robust). Each present root is checked against its own budget; an absent
root is skipped, so the gate holds identically on the monorepo (all three roots)
and the mirror (``baldur`` only). Each refactor lowers exactly the budget of the
root it touched.

**Unit = noqa LINES, not violations.** ``--add-noqa`` emits one line per ``def``
even when that ``def`` trips two or three of the rules, so a
``# noqa: C901, PLR0912`` line counts once. The budget tracks lines (the natural
``--add-noqa`` unit and the per-function refactor worklist), not the ~253 raw
violations.

**Code tokenization mirrors ruff.** ruff splits the codes after ``noqa:`` on
commas AND whitespace and matches them case-sensitively, so ``# noqa: C901
PLR0912`` (space-separated) and ``# noqa: C901 keep this`` (trailing reason) both
suppress C901, while lowercase ``c901`` does not. The counter extracts
case-sensitive ``[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+`` code tokens from the whole post-``noqa:``
remainder to match ruff exactly - a comma-only split would miss the
space-separated / trailing-reason forms and let a genuinely complex ``def``
grandfather itself invisibly to the exact-match budget.

**Known limitations.** A bare ``# noqa`` (no codes - suppresses everything) is
not counted, so it could bypass the budget; bare noqa is a review-caught bad
practice and ruff places the complexity noqa on the ``def`` line with explicit
codes. Off-line placement, and a complexity code appearing inside a string
literal (a non-comment ``"# noqa: C901"``), are likewise out of the line-scan
counter's reach.

The grandfathered ``# noqa`` set is the per-function refactor worklist; the
systematic refactor is a tracked OOS backlog item, with this gate guaranteeing
the debt shrinks and never grows.
