"""G43 — shipped Grafana dashboard queries MUST name live registry metrics.

The two sample dashboards under ``examples/monitoring/`` (the OSS overview and
the PRO operations board) ship with the ``baldur[prometheus]`` extra. Every
Prometheus panel query in them references framework metric series by name. Those
names were once authored by guessing — before the recorder layer existed — and
silently rotted (``baldur_retry_total`` / ``baldur_requests_total`` never
existed), rendering empty panels with nothing in CI to catch it.

This guard closes that hole. It snapshots the LIVE Prometheus registry after
importing the metric modules, extracts the metric-name tokens from every panel
``target.expr`` in both dashboards, and asserts each token is a registered
series name. A typo or a renamed metric turns the build red on the next commit.

Scope boundary — name existence, NOT population. A registered-but-dead name
(e.g. the bare ``circuit_breaker_state`` duplicate) would pass: population is a
runtime property a static content gate cannot assert without driving traffic.
The panels are hand-authored against empirically-verified populated names, and
the manual render success criteria cover population. Registration is
PRO-independent — every recorder registers its ``baldur_``-prefixed series at
construction gated only on ``prometheus_client``, so the PRO operations-board
series (DLQ, throttle, canary, emergency, notification, watchdog, bulkhead) all
resolve on an OSS-only checkout; this guard does NOT skip PRO tokens and needs
no PRO-name allowlist.

The PromQL metric-name tokenizer is shared with G48
(``test_prometheus_alert_metric_drift.py``) via ``_promql.py`` so the two
metric-drift guards cannot drift apart.
