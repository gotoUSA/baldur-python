"""G21 — no tests/ TEST file may classify as pure_pro / support_only.

CLAUDE.md § Test Location Rules + impl doc 533 D12. The 533 ``git mv`` is
one-time: G19 guards only marker presence and G20 only the private-import axis.
Neither stops a *new* ``pure_pro`` / ``support_only`` test — one whose
production-import graph shows its system-under-test is PRO — from being added
to ``tests/`` and shipping at the next mirror build (the path-level
allowlist publishes ``tests/`` wholesale, so G2 recurs). G21 closes that
axis permanently.

Single source of truth (533 D12): G21 reuses the rewritten classifier's
per-file verdict function ``scripts.classify_pro_importing_tests.classify_file``
— there is no second copy to drift. The function is pure AST/string analysis
that never imports ``baldur_pro``, so it runs in the public mirror where
``scripts/`` is published wholesale and the PRO package source is absent.

Scope (matches the move plan): TEST files only (``test_*.py``). conftest.py /
__init__.py are directory infrastructure — a PRO-importing conftest that
legitimately serves staying boundary tests is acceptable public-API surface
(533 R2) and is checked for private leaks by G20, not relocated by G21.

G21 keys off ``pure_pro`` + ``support_only`` only, NOT ``pro_dominant``: the 8
named ``pro_dominant`` STAY boundary tests (533 D3) are never re-flagged, which
is why D3 needs no machine-readable allowlist file. A future edit that strips a
STAY file's OSS imports down to ``pure_pro`` SHOULD trip G21 — that is correct
behavior, not a false positive: the file would then genuinely belong in
``tests/pro/``.

ENFORCED-EMPTY baseline (533 D12, same rationale as G20): a baseline entry
would whitelist the leak it documents, so the second test method meta-asserts
the key stays empty.
