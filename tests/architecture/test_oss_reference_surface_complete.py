"""G25 — OSS reference-surface completeness.

The published API reference (``docs/reference/**``) renders each curated
``__all__`` facade. Historically every large package was documented with a
single whole-package ``::: baldur.<pkg>`` directive that auto-tracked
``__all__`` — a new symbol appeared on the page for free. Impl doc 554 split
the oversized pages into hand-authored themed per-symbol pages, which removed
that inherent drift-freeness. G25 restores it: every obligated package's
``__all__`` symbol MUST be rendered by some ``:::`` directive somewhere under
``docs/reference/**``.

Coverage model — **leaf-name** (554 D3). Three models were prototyped; only
leaf-name is green on the real tree, because directive forms are heterogeneous
and Python re-export shadowing corrupts object identity:

* A whole-package directive (``::: P`` where ``P`` imports as a package) covers
  **all** of ``P.__all__``.
* A symbol/plain-module directive covers its ``rsplit('.', 1)`` leaf, attributed
  to package ``P`` when the directive's parent is ``P`` (e.g. ``::: baldur.init``
  → ``baldur``) or a non-package module directly under ``P`` (the decorators
  ``::: baldur.decorators.dlq_protect.dlq_protect`` disambiguation form →
  ``baldur.decorators``).

A package is **complete** iff ``set(P.__all__) ⊆ covered_leaves(P)``.

Obligated-package discovery (no hardcoded list): a directive target that
resolves to a **package** obligates that package; a genuine **symbol** target
(no such module on disk) obligates its attributed package. A directive whose
target resolves to a plain **module** (``baldur.protect_facade`` / ``baldur.core.exceptions``)
contributes a covered leaf to its parent package but does NOT obligate anything
— this is why plain modules and non-curated parents (``baldur.core``,
``baldur.adapters``) stay out of the obligated set, yielding exactly the curated
reference packages.

Classification is driven by ``importlib.util.find_spec`` (which inspects the
import system WITHOUT executing a target's ``__init__``), so the rule never
imports optional-extra adapters (``django`` / ``fastapi`` / ``flask`` /
``gunicorn``) — their pages are whole-package directives and therefore complete
by construction. Only the leaf-split packages (all core, no extras) are fully
imported to read ``__all__`` for the completeness check.

Allowlist is reviewed and enforced-near-empty — it holds only the public symbols
that genuinely cannot be rendered by a per-symbol ``:::`` directive:
``baldur.__version__`` (a version string) and the two ``baldur.services``
security accessors built by a generic singleton factory via tuple-unpacking
(griffe cannot statically resolve a factory-closure target). A new uncovered
``__all__`` symbol is given a ``:::`` directive, never baselined.
