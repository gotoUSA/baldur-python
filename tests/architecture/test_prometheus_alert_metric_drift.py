"""G48 — shipped Prometheus alert rules MUST name live registry metrics.

The sample alert file ``examples/monitoring/prometheus-alerts.yml`` ships with
the ``baldur[prometheus]`` extra alongside the two Grafana dashboards. Every
alert ``expr`` references framework metric series by name. Like the dashboard
panels G43 guards, those names were once authored against a guessed metric set
and silently rotted — rules dividing by the never-existent ``baldur_requests_total``
or the typo'd ``baldur_retry_total`` can never fire, with nothing in CI to catch
it. G43 only scans the two dashboard JSONs, so the alert surface was unguarded.

This guard closes that hole on the alert surface. It parses every ``expr`` in
the YAML, extracts the metric-name tokens, **filters to ``baldur_``-prefixed
tokens** (the alert file legitimately mixes namespaces — ``up`` from the
scrape target and OTel-native ``http_server_*`` series from DjangoInstrumentor
are framework-foreign and not ours to validate), and asserts each token is a
registered series name. A typo or a renamed metric turns the build red.

Scope boundary — name existence, NOT population (the same boundary G43
documents). A registered-but-never-populated name passes; population is a
runtime property a static content gate cannot assert without driving traffic.
The manual-render / live-scrape success criteria cover population.

Snapshot construction — union of TWO registration sources (NOT ``get_metrics()``,
which under an ``otel_collector`` observability profile returns the OTel backend
exposing only a ~7-recorder subset via ``PrometheusMetricReader``, yielding false
"unregistered" verdicts for prometheus-only series):

* importing ``baldur.services.metrics.definitions`` + ``...recorders`` registers
  the **module-level** series at import (e.g. ``baldur_canary_governance_bypass_total``,
  which is NOT in any per-domain recorder — dropping this import false-positives
  the untouched ``canary_alerts`` rule); and
* instantiating ``BaldurMetrics()`` directly registers the **per-domain recorder**
  series (``baldur_circuit_breaker_state``, ``baldur_retry_outcomes_total``,
  ``baldur_http_requests_total``, ``baldur_dlq_pending_count``, ...).

Both imports are load-bearing. The only difference from G43's snapshot is the
final ``get_metrics()`` -> ``BaldurMetrics()`` substitution, which makes the
snapshot independent of the ambient observability profile.

The PromQL metric-name tokenizer is shared with G43 via ``_promql.py``.
