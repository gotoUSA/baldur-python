"""Location-robust repo-root / src-root resolution for test path computation.

Test files that read source files (AST / contract checks) historically hardcoded
the repo root as a fixed-depth ``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[N]``. That
depth is wrong on the published OSS mirror, where ``publish_mirror.sh`` renames
``tests/`` -> ``tests/`` (removing one path segment): a file drops one level,
so ``parents[N]`` climbs one level too high and the derived ``src/baldur/...``
path misresolves to a ``FileNotFoundError``.

These helpers walk up to the nearest ancestor holding ``pyproject.toml`` instead
of counting levels, so they resolve correctly in BOTH layouts. ``pyproject.toml``
ships to the mirror, and ``tests/factories/`` itself is NOT renamed by the mirror
(only ``tests/`` is), so this module's own location is stable. Mirrors the
self-contained ``_locate_project_root()`` in
``tests/architecture/_helpers.py``.
